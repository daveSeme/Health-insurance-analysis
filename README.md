Report: Analysis of Health Insurance Data

In this analysis, I explored a dataset related to health insurance, aiming to gain insights into various factors that affect insurance charges. The analysis was carried out using both **Jupyter Notebook and a web application**.

**Jupyter Notebook Analysis:**

**Data Preparation and Overview:**

I began by importing essential Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
Loaded the health insurance dataset and performed initial exploratory data analysis.
Checked for data types, missing values, and basic statistics.

**Data Visualization**:

Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to create visualizations.
Plotted bar charts and trend-line charts to represent age distribution, BMI distribution, insurance charges by age, and insurance charges by BMI categories.
Analyzed these visualizations to draw initial insights.

**Insights from Visualizations:**

Identified key trends, such as higher insurance counts in certain age groups (20-29 and 40-49) and differences in BMI distribution between genders.

**Web Application Analysis:**

**Application Structure:**

Developed a web application using Flask, integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user interaction and visualization display.
Created a user-friendly interface allowing users to view and interact with visualizations.

**Interactive Visualizations:**

**Integrated interactive visualizations within the web application.**
Provided hover and click effects to enhance user experience and understanding.
Insights and User Interaction:

**Enabled users to click on visualizations, revealing insightful comments related to each chart.**
Enhanced user engagement by providing dynamic insights based on user interactions.
By utilizing both Jupyter Notebook for initial data analysis and visualization and a web application for interactive and user-friendly insights, I successfully explored the health insurance dataset, visualized crucial trends, and facilitated a more engaging and interactive experience for users.
